                      <p>
                        I am a Web Developer & Programmer living in pune, India.
                        I make web applications, usually with Javascript
                        Frameworks & Libraries.
                      </p>
                      {/* <p> Hello. I'm Amit and I'm a multi-talented human. Most of my time I create and build digital products.</p> */}
                      <p>
                        I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I
                        define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be
                        taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep
                        learning, continue challenging myself, and do
                        interesting things that matter.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I primarily use MEAN stack, but picking up a new
                        freamework or language isn't a problem. I have extensive
                        programming experience and I'm comfortable developing on
                        the frontend or backend as well as setting up or
                        managing infrastructure.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm,
                        I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my
                        fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate,
                        expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability
                        to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just
                        come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive
                        need to act on them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many
                        interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic
                        endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new
                        skills and juggle different projects and roles with
                        relative ease. I like to develop expertise in a number
                        of areas over the course of my life and career.

                      <p>
                        I’m a people-person with deep emotions and empathy, a
                        natural storyteller. I’m able to inspire and am at my
                        best when I’m sharing my creative expressions with
                        others.
