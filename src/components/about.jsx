                    <p>I am a Web Developer & Programmer living in pune, India. I make web applications, usually with Javascript Frameworks & Libraries.</p>
                    {/* <p> Hello. I'm Amit and I'm a multi-talented human. Most of my time I create and build digital products.</p> */}
                    <p>I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.</p>
                    <p>I primarily use MEAN stack, but picking up a new freamework or language isn't a problem. I have extensive programming experience and I'm comfortable developing on the frontend or backend as well as setting up or managing infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m
easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations
wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented
spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never
satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost
impulsive need to act on them.</p>
<p>My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests,
hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner,
able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles
with relative ease. I like to develop expertise in a number of areas
over the course of my life and career.</p>
<p>I’m a people-person with deep emotions and empathy, a natural
storyteller. I’m able to inspire and am at my best when I’m
sharing my creative expressions with others.</p>
